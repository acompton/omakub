This is the hacky customization of Omakub I use. It is **not tested**, 
**not supported**, and **highly unlikely to succeed** in provisioning 
a clean Ubuntu install. Use it at your own risk!

Summary of differences, probably not exhaustive:

| Standard Omakub | My preference |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| alacritty       | ghostty       |
| bash            | zsh           |
| chrome          | chromium      |
| zellij          | tmux          |
| tactile         | ubuntu tiling |
| Hey             | (omit)        |
| Basecamp        | (omit)        |
| Typora          | (omit)        |
| Docker          | (omit)        | 

### TODO
Some gaps in case I ever decide to come back to this.
* Install tmux, ghostty, podman. This currently assumes they are already present.
* Add ghostty theme support
* Add tmux theme support
* Actually test

# Omakub

Turn a fresh Ubuntu installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omakub. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omakub is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.
